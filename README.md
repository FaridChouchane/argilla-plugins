# Argilla Plugins

> ðŸ”Œ Open-source plugins for extra features and workflows

**Why?**  
The design of Argilla is intentionally programmable (i.e., developers can build complex workflows for reading and updating datasets). However, there are certain workflows and features which are shared across different use cases and could be simplified from a developer experience perspective. In order to facilitate the reuse of key workflows and empower the community, Argilla Plugins provides a collection of extensions to super power your Argilla use cases.
Some of this pluggable method could be eventually integrated into the [core of Argilla](https://github.com/argilla-io/argilla).

## Reporting

**What is it?** 
Create interactive reports about dataset activity, dataset features, annotation tasks, model predictions, and more.

Plugins:
- [ ] automated reporting pluging using `datapane`. issue
- [ ] automated reporting pluging for `great-expectations`. issue

## Datasets

**What is it?** 
Everything that involves operations on a `dataset level`, like dividing work, syncing datasets, and deduplicating records.

Plugins:
- [ ] sync data between datasets
  - [ ] directional A->B. issue
  - [ ] bi-directional A <-> B. issue
- [ ] remove duplicate records. issue
- [ ] create train test splits. issue
- [ ] set limits to records in datasets
  - [ ] end of life time. issue
  - [ ] max # of records. issue

## Programmatic Labelling

**What is it?** 
Automatically update `annotations` and `predictions` labels and predictions of `records` based on heuristics.

Plugins:
- [ ] annotated spans as gazzetteer for labelling. issue
- [ ] vector search queries and similarity threshold. issue
- [ ] use separate gazzetteer for labelling. issue
- [ ] materialize annotations/predictions from rules using Snorkel or a MajorityVoter

## Active learning

**What is it?** 
A process during which a learning algorithm can interactively query a user (or some other information source) to label new data points.

- [ ] active learning for `TextClassification`.
  - [ ] `classy-classification`. issue
  - [ ] `small-text`. issue
- [ ] active learning for `TokenClassification`. issue

## Inference endpoints
**What is it?** 
Automatically add predictions to records as they are logged into Argilla. This can be used for making it really easy to pre-annotated a dataset with an existing model or service.

- [ ] TBD

## Training endpoints
**What is it?** 
Automatically train a model based on dataset annotations.

- [ ] TBD
